#Create a network and client using DHCP commands:
## dhcpconfig -N 192.169.1.0 -m 255.255.255.0 -t 192.169.1.1
## pntadm -A 192.169.1.3 192.169.1.0
#Update /etc/netmasks to add entry
#192.169.1.0 255.255.255.0
#
#Action 2:
#
#Check the newly added client does not appear in the ai_manager list using the command:
## /ericsson/ocs/bin/ai_manager.sh -list all
#
#Action 3:
#
#Add a client to this network using ai_manager.sh script
## /ericsson/ocs/bin/ai_manager.sh -add client -a 192.169.1.4 -h AI_RBS1 - i AI_RBS1 -s 10.42.33.22 -p /var/tmp/SummaryFile.xml
