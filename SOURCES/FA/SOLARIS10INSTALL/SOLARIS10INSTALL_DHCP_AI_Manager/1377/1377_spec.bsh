# BEGIN_MANUAL_STEPS
#ADD RANGE Negative Testing
#Test adding a dynamic range to that network using the ai manager â€“add range function.
#
#Validate ip addresses -n, -b, -e, -s , -t and -w; ensure they refuse nonsense ipaddresses
#
#-n - valid network address
#-n (non numerical ip) ; Non numeric in the IP Address [10.xx.38.0]
#-n (non 4 octets) ; Must have 4 octets in the IP Address [10.4238.0]
#-n (out of range) ; Out of range in the IP Address [10.42.999.50]
#-n (network address that doesn't exist) ; Network doesn't exist. Create network before adding a range.
#
#-b - valid beginning range ip
#-b (non numerical ip) ; -b (non 4 octets) ; -b (out of range)
#-b (belonging to another network than -n) ; Beginning IP for the range not valid; 
#
#-e - valid end range ip
#-e (non numerical ip) ; -e (non 4 octets) ; -e (out of range)
#-e (belonging to another network than -n) ; Ending IP for the range not valid: 
#-e (end before start) ; Range Ending IP must be of a higher value than Range Beginning IP
#-e (end is at least 3 ip addresses after start) ; Range must contain at least 3 ip addresses
#
#-s - SMRS server address
#-s (non numerical ip) ; -s (non 4 octets) ; -s (out of range) 
#
#-t and -w parameters need to be test with just a primary server and also when there is a primary and secondary server
#(when there are two ip addresses to be specified, ensure that they are seperated by a comma and not a space, ensure also that there is no more than two ip addresses allowed)
#
#-t "<Primary NTP time server> <Secondary NTP server>"
#-t (non numerical ip) ; -t (non 4 octets) ; -t (out of range) 
#
#-w "<Primary web server> <Secondary web server>"
#-w (non numerical ip) ; -w (non 4 octets) ; -w (out of range)
