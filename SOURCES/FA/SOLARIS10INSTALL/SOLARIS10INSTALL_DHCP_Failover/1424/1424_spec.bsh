#<path under "Verification Specification for Cominf Feature Test for 14.0 ":
#Initial Installation/DHCP Failover/ISC DHCP IPv4 Failover
#>  
#
#Verify that the relevant IPv4 DHCP configuration files are copied from the DHCP active server to the correct location on the non-active DHCP server as defined by the cronjob.
#In this test case the DHCP active server is the Slave server and the DHCP non-active server is the Master server.
#
#Precondition: 
#MWS , 
#OSS MS,
#om_serv_master , om_serv_slave
#MWS, profile for om_serv_master configured for IPv4 and IPv6(Dualstack).
#MWS, profile for om_serv_slave configured for IPv4 and IPv6(Dualstack).
#MWS configured with latest Solaris, Solaris O&M media, COMInf media
#‘om_serv_master’, ‘om_serv_slave’ successfully jumpstarted with COMInf media using MWS.
#
#Slave server is the active DHCP server.
#IPv4 daemon only running on Slave server. 
#
#IPv6 interface file , /etc/hostname6.<interface>, has been renamed. Server restarted to disable IPv6 daemon.
#A cronjob exists on both the master server and slave server for the script ‘/ericsson/ocs/bin/dhcp_check.sh’, to transfer the IPv4 DHCP files between the active DHCP server and the non-active server.
#
#
# END_PRE_CONDITIONS


# BEGIN_MANUAL_STEPS
#Action 1: 
#Execute the command ‘crontab –l’ to verify the time of the next DHCP file transfer between active DHCP server and non-active DHCP server.
#The default time is for file transfer is ‘01,31’ past the hour.
#
#Note: The default time can be changed for test purposes using the command ‘crontab –e’ to a shorter time interval.
#
#
#Action 2: 
#Verify the DHCP IPv4 daemon is only running on the Slave server. This can be verified by using the command, 
#ps -ef | grep -i dhcp
#
#
#Action 3: 
#Wait until the next cronjob time has elapsed.
#
#Action 4: 
#On the Slave server (DHCP active server) , modify the following file, '/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf_static’.
#
#On the Slave server(DHCP active server) , modify the following file, '/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf_subnet’.
#
#On the Slave server(DHCP active server) , modify the following file, '‘/var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases'.
#
#On the Slave server(DHCP active server) , modify the following file, ‘/ericsson/ocs/etc/aif_hosts'.
#
#
#Action 5: 
#Wait until the next cronjob for DHCP configuration file transfer has occurred.
#The cronjob executes the script, 'ericsson/ocs/bin/dhcp_check.sh'
#Verify with ‘crontab –l’ command.
#Note time on server.
#
#Action 6: 
#On the Master (non-active) server, verify the IPv4 DHCP configuration files have been copied to the /var/tmp/ directory.
#Verify the following files are copied from the Slave (active) DHCP server to the Master (non-active) DHCP server:
#
#/var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases to /var/tmp/ on Master server
#/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf_subnet to /var/tmp/ on Master server
#/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf to /var/tmp/ on Master server
#/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf_static to /var/tmp/ on Master server
#/ericsson/ocs/etc/aif_hosts to /var/tmp/ on Master server
#
#Execute the command ‘ls-ltr’ on the directory /var/tmp/ on the Master server.
#Note the time the IPv4 DHCP configuration files were transferred.
#
#Verify the files modified on the Slave server in Step 4 are copied correctly to the Master server:
#dhcpd.conf_static
#dhcpd.conf_subnet
#dhcpd.leases
#aif_hosts'
#
#
#Action 7: 
#On both the Master and Slave servers verify a file ,’ sys_dhcp_copied_file.log’, exists in the directory , ‘/ericsson/ocs/log/’
#
#Verify the file contains the latest information relating to the latest IPv4 DHCP configuration file transfer between the DHCP (active) Slave server and the (non-active ) Master DHCP server.
#
#Verify the files are identical on both the Master and Slave server.
#
#Verify the logfile contains an entry for the files previously modified on the Slave server in Step 4.
