#
#Verify the activation of DHCP on the Master server following the shutdown of the Slave server ,Master server remains DHCP active server after Slave server restarted
#
#Precondition: 
#MWS , 
#OSS MS,
#om_serv_master , om_serv_slave
#MWS, profile for om_serv_master configured for IPv4 and IPv6(Dualstack).
#MWS, profile for om_serv_slave configured for IPv4 and IPv6(Dualstack).
#MWS configured with latest Solaris, Solaris O&M media, COMInf media
#‘om_serv_master’, ‘om_serv_slave’ successfully jumpstarted with COMInf media using MWS.
#
#Slave server is the active DHCP server.
#IPv4 and IPv6 daemons running on Slave server. 
#
#A cronjob exists on both the master server and slave server for the script ‘/ericsson/ocs/bin/dhcp_check.sh’, to transfer the IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP files between the active DHCP server and the non-active server.

#Action 1: 
#Power down the Slave server.

#Action 2: 
#On the Master server, execute the following command:

#
#Action 3: 
#Verify a logfile, ‘/ericsson/ocs/log/sys_activate_isc_dhcp.<timestamp>.log’ is generated on the Master server in the following directory, /ericsson/ocs/log/.
#
#Verify the logfile contents contains information relevant to the activation of DHCP on the Master server. 
#
#Verify the IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP configuration files are copied from the /var/tmp/ to the correct location on the server to enable IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP.

#Action 4: 
#On the Master server, execute the following command to verify the IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP daemons are running on the Master server.
#ps -ef | grep -i dhcp
#
#Action 5: 
#On the Master server, verify the IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP configuration files have been correctly copied to the correct locations.
