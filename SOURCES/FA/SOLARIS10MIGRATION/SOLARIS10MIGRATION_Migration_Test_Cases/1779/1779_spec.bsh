# BEGIN_MANUAL_STEPS
#Action 1: 
#
#Verify the minimal backup by running the command
##/ericsson/ocs/bin/preMIG_bkup.sh
#
#Action 2: 
#
#Verify the contents of the backup list file and backup tar file
#
#Action 3: 
#
#Verify the custom backup using the custom_mig_file
#
#Action 4: 
#
#Verify the log file for this
#
#Action 4: 
#
#Verify the restore script
# 
# END_MANUAL_STEPS

# BEGIN_POST_CONDITIONS
#Result 1: 
#The script executes successfully and a backup list file and backup tar file is created in the location /var/tmp with the names preMIGbckup<host name>.tar and preMIGbckup_list
##cd /var/tmp
##ls Ã¢Euro lrt preMIGbckup*
#
#Result 2: 
#The contents are correct and all expected contents are contained.
#
#Result 3: 
#The script executes successfully and backup is created. The backup contains the custom_mig_contents
#
#Result 4:
