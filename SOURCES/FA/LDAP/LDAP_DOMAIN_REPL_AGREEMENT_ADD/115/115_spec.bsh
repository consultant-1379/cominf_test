# BEGIN_PRE_CONDITIONS
#1- At least one domain with replication enabled for both servers
#2- An ldif file with the changes you want to introduce is available e.g
#
#[root@atclvm425 bin]# cat /tmp/newuser.ldif
#dn: cn=msadmin2,dc=1,dc=com
#objectClass: person
#objectClass: top
#description: something here
#cn: MasterServer Admin
#cn: msadmin2
#sn: MasterServer Admin
#[root@atclvm425 bin]#
#
#3- An ldif file to remove the changes that are introduced is available e.g
#
#[root@atclvm425 bin]# cat /tmp/deletenewuser.ldif
#dn: cn=msadmin2,dc=1,dc=com
#changetype: delete
#[root@atclvm425 bin]#
# END_PRE_CONDITIONS


# BEGIN_MANUAL_STEPS
#in the steps below atclvm425 is the host name for the primary server and atclvm426 is the host name for the secondary. Please replace the host names as necessary.
#
#1- Ensure replication is enabled for the domain you are targeting by running /ericsson/sdee/bin/prepReplication.sh -l domain -d <domain name here>
#2- Conduct an ldapsearch and ensure msadmin2 is not listed in any of the servers
#3- Run ./ldapmodify -h atclvm425 -p 389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w shroot12 -f /tmp/newuser.ldif to insert the new user to the primary server
#4- Conduct the same search performed in step 2. This time the msadmin2 record is listed on both servers. Running the command in step 1 should show the entries being incremented
#5- Run ./ldapmodify -h atclvm425 -p 389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w shroot12 -f /tmp/deletenewuser.ldif
#6- Conduct an ldapsearch and ensure msadmin2 is not listed in any of the servers. Running the command in step 1 should show the entries being decremented
#7- Run ./ldapmodify -h atclvm426 -p 389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w shroot12 -f /tmp/newuser.ldif to insert the new user to the secondary server
#8- Conduct the same search performed in step 2. This time the msadmin2 record is listed on both servers. Running the command in step 1 should show the entries being incremented
#9- Run ./ldapmodify -h atclvm426 -p 389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w shroot12 -f /tmp/deletenewuser.ldif
#10- Conduct an ldapsearch and ensure msadmin2 is not listed in any of the servers. Running the command in step 1 should show the entries being decremented
